# About The Application:  
**LowKey - Password Manager** is a personal project created to understand the concepts of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, including **Webpack and modules**.  
I created this project on **Feb 20, 2025**, as a way to **retake and pursue my web development career**.  
The reason why I chose a password manager is because I remember having created this in Java during my university years and thought to myself that I had fun doing that.  
Furthermore, this project helped me to understand **JavaScript modules** further and made me see my mistakes and beginner understanding.
